## Future Enhancements
As of now Random Chef generates the same recipes if same ingredients and searched. I choose to keep it this way so user could access same recipe in case page reloads or crashes. In the future I'd like to implement better randomizations, but with a tool to save/store the recipe you want in a folder.
